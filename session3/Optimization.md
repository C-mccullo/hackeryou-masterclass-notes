# Optimization

## Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow.

### Optimization Best Practices

#### Rule 1:  Don’t Optimize
Premature optimization can often come at the cost of maintainability.  You are building for other developers, not a compiler.

#### Rule 2:  Don’t Optimize Yet
Until you see the pieces come together, you’re not sure of what you are optimizing.

#### Rule 3:  Profile First
Use your tools to see what you are actually optimizing.
