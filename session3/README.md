# Session 3: Complexity and Performance

This session focuses on algorithm complexity and performance in computer science. In particular, we will discuss lists and collections, and how to optimally search, sort and manipulate these sets of items.

## Outline

The agenda for this session will be as follows:

1. [Optimization](Optimization.md): This initial discussion will cover the concept of optimization, considerations before optimizing, and how to effectively optimize.

2. [Introduction](Introduction.md): We introduce several key concepts via a discussion of sorting. This includes algorithms, performance, scale, and complexity.

3. [](Dictionaries.md):  Describes the different types of dictionaries and compare them with links.
    
4. [Trees](Trees.md): Covers a simple implementation of a tree with an overview on traversing.
