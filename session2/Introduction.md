# Introduction

## Building Blocks

A deep understanding of data structures, also known as **containers**, are key to 
software design and design patterns.  The choice of data structure can 
significantly impact the performance of an algorithm. 

Just like a builder will use a hammer to solve some problems, or a screwdriver
to solve others, a programmer must choose the correct data structure for
the job too.

While they may have various names depending on the programming language, there are 
a few abstract data structures that are core to software development:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Use Cases</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lists</td>
      <td>
        Store data in a linear sequence of values that can be accessed in various ways.
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining ordered data</li>
            <li>Maintaining history of data</li>
            <li>Processing queues</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dictionaries</td>
      <td>
        Store data to enable quick lookups based on a unique key.  
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
            <li>In-memory databases</li>
            <li>Caching</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trees</td>
      <td>
        Store data in a way that represents hierarchical relationships.
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimized search algorithms</li>
            <li>Maintaining a hierarchy of information</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
