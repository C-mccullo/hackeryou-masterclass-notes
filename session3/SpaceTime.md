# Space & Time


## Can we sort this pile of books?

Given a relatively small collection, we may not notice the difference between many of the more popular sorting algorithms. Even a measurable improvement will be minimal; perhaps barely visible.


## Now what !?

We can see that as the size of the collection increases, the sorting strategy we choose has a significant impact. The amount of time could increase exponentially (literally!). The amount of space (ie. memory) that is required to maneuver the collection's items could be significant -- or possibly even impossible.

### Details to consider

* Data structure used to represent the "item"
* Expected number of items in the collection
* Size of each item
* Amount of effort involved with moving (re-ordering) the items
* Time available to complete the task
* Amount of free memory available to complete the task
